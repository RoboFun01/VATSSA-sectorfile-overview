==== TopSky Track Labels for FASA ====
The track labels have been set to replicate the IRL track labels used by ATNS in South African airspace. Please **do not** edit them as they have been specifically set up to allow certain coordination procedures to work. The track labels will display Mode S data based on the aircraft's equipment code.
